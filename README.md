# 2e Character Sheet

## Overview
This repository supports a digital character sheet for AD&D 2nd Edition, designed for use with the Roll20 virtual tabletop.

This character sheet provides a complete interface for managing AD&D 2e characters. You'll find everything you need to manage a character from their basic bio, ability scores, gear, and wealth, to specific weapons and spells available with their applicable stat lines and practical roll buttons for their initiative, attack, and damage rolls.

This sheet was built from an [existing 2e character sheet](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/AD%26D_2E), but with a visual overhaul to a dark-mode theme, a redesign to condense and reorganize information, along with new features like managing gear and currency between ones person and their stash, tracking experience gains with a log, managing temporary combat buffs, etc. A key feature is the simplified combat tab which reduces sheet scope to combat encounter related information only, such as the weapon and spell sections along with ability checks and saving throws in a condensed view. Most of sheet interaction within a session is combat-related, so this helps to reduce searcing around the sheet for a simple sword swing or fireball casting, keeping the game moving!
